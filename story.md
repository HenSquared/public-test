# The Last Duck of Autumn

The morning mist clung to the surface of Mirror Lake like a whispered secret. Sarah stood at the edge of the wooden dock, her breath forming small clouds in the crisp October air. She clutched a paper bag filled with stale bread—the last remnants of yesterday's bakery visit.

For three weeks, she had come here every morning, and for three weeks, the same lone duck had greeted her. Unlike the others who had already migrated south, this one stayed behind, circling the dock in patient loops.

"Why don't you go?" Sarah whispered, tearing a piece of bread into smaller bits. "Your friends left weeks ago."

The duck—she'd named him Chester—paddled closer, his dark eyes bright with recognition. He made a soft quacking sound, almost conversational, as if answering her question.

Sarah smiled despite herself. She knew why she came back every day. After losing her job and her apartment, after her sister stopped returning her calls, this simple ritual was the only constant in her life. But what was Chester's reason for staying?

As she tossed the bread onto the water, she noticed something different. Chester wasn't alone. Three other ducks emerged from the reeds, tentatively approaching. They were smaller, younger, and one appeared to be limping.

Understanding dawned on her. Chester wasn't lost or stubborn. He was waiting—waiting for these stragglers to heal, to grow strong enough for the long journey ahead. He was their guardian.

Sarah sat down on the dock, letting her legs dangle over the edge. "You're not stuck," she said softly. "You're just not ready to leave yet."

Chester dipped his head, then looked up at her, and for a moment, Sarah could swear he understood.

The next morning, Sarah arrived at the lake with a lighter heart and a heavier bag of bread. But the dock was empty. The water lay still and silent, reflecting the golden sunrise. Chester and his little flock were gone.

Sarah stood there for a long moment, then smiled. She understood now. Being ready to leave didn't mean you were stuck when you stayed. It meant you were exactly where you needed to be, until you weren't anymore.

She turned from the lake and walked back toward town. She had a job application to submit and a phone call to make. She was ready.
