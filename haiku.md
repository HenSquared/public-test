## Nature's Whisper

An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the water
Splash! Silence again

## Autumn Evening

Autumn moonlight glows
A worm digs silently through
The chestnut burrows

## Spring Morning

Cherry blossoms fall
Softly dancing in spring breeze
Pink petals scatter

## Winter Solitude

Winter solitude
In a world of one color
The sound of the wind

## Summer Heat

Summer grass grows tall
Where brave warriors once stood
Dreams of ancient times
