# A Poem

The morning light breaks through the clouds,
A gentle whisper, soft and proud.
The world awakens, fresh and new,
With skies of ever-changing blue.

The trees sway gently in the breeze,
Their leaves dance freely in the air.
A bird sings out its morning song,
Inviting all to sing along.

So take a moment, pause, and see
The beauty that surrounds you, free.
For in each day there's joy to find,
If only you keep an open mind.
