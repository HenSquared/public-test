# A Poem

In the quiet of the morning light,
Where shadows dance and stars take flight,
The world awakens, soft and new,
With dewdrops glistening in the view.

The wind whispers through the trees,
Carrying secrets on the breeze,
Of dreams yet dreamed and paths untrod,
Of endless wonders, touched by God.

So pause a moment, take it in,
This fleeting beauty, let it begin,
To fill your heart with gentle grace,
And bring a smile upon your face.
