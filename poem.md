# A Poem

In lines of code we seek to find,
The logic dancing through our mind,
With every function, loop, and call,
We build our dreams, both big and small.

The cursor blinks upon the screen,
A world of bytes, unseen, serene,
Where errors teach and bugs reveal,
The patient craft that makes code real.

Through syntax bright and structure clear,
We conquer doubt and vanquish fear,
For in the art of what we make,
We leave our mark for others' sake.

So write with care, debug with grace,
Each line of code finds its place,
And in the end, what matters most,
Is not the code, but what it hosts—

The human touch, the spark of thought,
The problems solved, the battles fought,
In ones and zeros, hearts still beat,
When craft and purpose finally meet.
