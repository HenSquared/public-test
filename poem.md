# A Digital Dawn

Lines of code dance in the night,
Binary stars casting their light,
Algorithms weave their silent song,
In this realm where we belong.

Keyboards click like gentle rain,
Logic flows through every vein,
From chaos springs a world of art,
Technology and human heart.

The screen glows soft, a canvas bright,
Where dreams take form from morning light,
In ones and zeros, truth is found,
A universe of thoughts unbound.
