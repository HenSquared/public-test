# The Dance of Time

In the quiet workshop, gears whisper low,
Where moments are captured, row by row,
Each tick a heartbeat, each tock a sigh,
Of memories cherished as years go by.

The pendulum swings with a graceful arc,
Through dawn's soft light and evening's dark,
It measures the laughter, the tears, the song,
The brief hello, the farewell long.

Springs coiled tight with hope and dreams,
Nothing is quite as it seems,
For time is more than numbers on a face,
It's love and loss, and saving grace.

In every clock, a story waits,
Behind brass hands and golden plates,
The clockmaker knows what we forget:
That life's best moments haven't happened yet.

So wind your watch with gentle care,
And treasure each moment that we share,
For time may pass, but love endures,
In every tick, forever yours.
