# A Poem

In lines of code, we find our way,
Through bugs and tests, we seize the day.
With every commit, a story told,
Of logic crafted, brave and bold.

The cursor blinks, a patient friend,
Through endless loops that twist and bend.
In brackets nested, deep and wide,
Our aspirations learn to hide.

Yet push we must, and merge we shall,
Through every triumph, every fall.
For in this dance of ones and zeros,
We find ourselves as humble heroes.
