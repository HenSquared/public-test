# A Digital Dawn

In circuits deep where silence streams,
A spark ignites electric dreams,
Through copper veins and silicon threads,
Ideas flow where logic spreads.

The cursor blinks, a patient friend,
Awaiting words that we might send,
Each keystroke builds a bridge of thought,
Connecting minds that once were not.

In ones and zeros, worlds take form,
Through digital winds, a quiet storm,
We craft and code through day and night,
Creating futures, bold and bright.

So here we stand at dawn's first light,
Where human heart meets byte's delight,
Together building, line by line,
A future woven, yours and mine.
