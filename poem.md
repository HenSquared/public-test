# A Poem

In lines of code, we find our way,
Through bugs and builds that fill each day.
With logic sharp and syntax true,
We craft the dreams we dare pursue.

The cursor blinks, a steady beat,
As keystrokes dance beneath our feet.
From empty files to systems grand,
We build new worlds with our own hand.

Through errors faced and problems solved,
Our understanding has evolved.
In collaboration we grow strong,
Together, this is where we belong.
