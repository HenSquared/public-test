# A Poem

In lines of code, we write our dreams,
Where logic flows in silent streams.
Each function calls, each loop repeats,
A symphony of digital beats.

The keyboard clicks beneath our hands,
As we create what thought commands.
From simple scripts to systems grand,
We build new worlds, as we have planned.

In bytes and bits, our stories live,
With every pull request we give.
Together we build, commit, and share,
A codebase crafted with love and care.
