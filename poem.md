# A Poem

In lines of code, a story unfolds,
Where logic and beauty intertwine,
Each function a verse, precisely told,
Each variable a word, by design.

Through loops we dance in endless grace,
While conditions guide our way,
In this digital embrace,
We craft our work each day.

From bytes to dreams, we build and grow,
With patience and with care,
For in each line of code we sow,
A future beyond compare.
