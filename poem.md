# A Poem

In lines of code where logic flows,
Through bits and bytes, the program grows.
Each function speaks a silent song,
Where algorithms guide along.

The cursor blinks upon the screen,
A world of dreams, yet to be seen.
With every keystroke, worlds take flight,
From morning's glow to deepest night.

So write your code with care and grace,
Let creativity find its place.
For in these digital halls we roam,
The art of coding finds its home.
