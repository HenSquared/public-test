# A Poem

In lines of code we write and weave,
A tapestry that minds conceive,
Through logic's path and function's art,
Each program speaks from someone's heart.

The cursor blinks upon the screen,
A canvas waiting, fresh and clean,
Where thoughts transform to bytes and bits,
And creativity never quits.

From simple scripts to systems grand,
We build new worlds with mind and hand,
In every loop and every call,
A piece of us within it all.
