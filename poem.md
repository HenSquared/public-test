# A Poem

## Lines of Code

In the quiet hum of servers bright,
Where bytes and bits dance through the night,
A developer sits with coffee warm,
Crafting code through every storm.

Lines of logic, clean and true,
Functions built with careful view,
Each commit a stepping stone,
In this digital world we've grown.

Bugs may lurk in shadowed space,
But persistence wins the race,
With patience, skill, and curious mind,
Solutions we shall surely find.

So here's to those who build and dream,
Who work together as a team,
Creating wonders, line by line,
In code, we make our spirits shine.
