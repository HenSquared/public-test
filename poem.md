# A Poem

In lines of code we find our way,
Through logic's path, both night and day.
Each function crafted, tested true,
A bridge from old to something new.

The cursor blinks with patient grace,
While thoughts take form in digital space.
From simple scripts to systems grand,
We build with care and steady hand.

Through errors caught and bugs resolved,
Our problems faced and then dissolved.
In every merge and every test,
We strive to give our very best.
