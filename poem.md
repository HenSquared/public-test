# A Digital Dream

In circuits and code, where logic runs deep,  
A repository rests, where memories keep,  
Lines of text dance across the screen,  
A public test space, where wonders convene.

Through GitHub's realm, where developers play,  
Testing features, night and day,  
Each commit a story, each branch a dream,  
Nothing's quite as simple as it may seem.

Files scattered like stars in the night,  
Images and text, both dark and light,  
From ducks that gif to clockmaker's tales,  
The test repository never fails.

Pull requests merge with careful grace,  
Issues opened in their proper place,  
A sandbox of learning, trial and test,  
Where code experiments are at their best.

So here's to the repo, both humble and grand,  
A digital playground, close at hand,  
Where poems and stories can both reside,  
In this public test space, our coding guide.
