# Poem 2: The Dance of Code

In the realm of bits and bytes so grand,
Where logic flows like grains of sand,
A programmer sits with focused mind,
Solutions to complex problems they find.

Through loops and functions, night and day,
They craft their code in every way,
Debugging errors, line by line,
Until the program works just fine.

Commits are made with messages clear,
Pull requests reviewed without fear,
Tests run green, the build succeeds,
The codebase grows with careful deeds.

In repositories far and wide,
Where collaboration is our guide,
We write, we merge, we innovate,
Together we create something great.

So here's to code and poetry too,
Both are art in all they do,
One with words, one with logic pure,
Both expressions that endure.
