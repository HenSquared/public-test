A Digital Dawn

In circuits deep where electrons flow,
Through silicon valleys, data glows,
A world of ones and zeros bright,
Dancing through the endless night.

The code we write, the dreams we share,
Float gently through the digital air,
Connections made across the void,
Where human hearts cannot be destroyed.

From keyboards spring the thoughts we weave,
In algorithms we believe,
Yet still remains, through screen and wire,
The spark of human heart's desire.

So let us build with care and grace,
This digital, connected space,
Where technology and soul combine,
In harmony, by grand design.
