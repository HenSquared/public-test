The Digital Garden

In circuits deep and lines of code,
Where silent data streams do flow,
A garden grows without a seed,
Where ideas bloom and logic leads.

Through branches merged and commits made,
In repositories, dreams are laid,
Each pull request, a flower bright,
Illuminates the developer's night.

The bugs may crawl, the tests may fail,
But persistence tells the tale,
With every push and every clone,
We build a world we've never known.

So here we stand, with keyboards near,
Creating futures without fear,
In this digital domain we roam,
The code we write becomes our home.
