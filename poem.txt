A Digital Dream

In lines of code, a world unfolds,
Where logic dances, stories told.
Through repositories deep and wide,
Solutions flow like morning tide.

Commits like footsteps in the sand,
Each change a mark by human hand.
Branches reaching, testing paths,
While merging brings us aftermath.

In GitHub's realm, we build and grow,
Where collaboration's seeds we sow.
From issue threads to pull requests,
Together we create what's best.

So here's my verse, both simple, true,
A poem written just for you.
In this repository, now it stays,
A testament to coding days.
