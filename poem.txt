A Code's Journey

In circuits deep where logic flows,
Through binary streams the data goes,
Each function called, each loop that spins,
A digital dance that never ends.

From morning light to evening's glow,
The keyboards click, the ideas grow,
Developers craft with careful thought,
Creating worlds from lines they've wrought.

Through bugs and fixes, tests that run,
The code evolves till it is done,
A testament to human minds,
That build the future, one line at a time.

In repositories far and wide,
Where commits and branches coincide,
The work continues, day by day,
As software shapes the world's new way.
